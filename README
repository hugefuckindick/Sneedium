In order to build sneedium you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.

In order to use the functionality of the url-bar, also install dmenu[0].

Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sneedium is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sneedium (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running sneedium
------------

    sneedium [URI]

See the manpage for further options.

Running sneedium in tabbed

which is run like this:

    scripts/sneedium-open.sh [URI]
